# Openning remarks:
1. Tuesday 3/19/19 [Software Test Automation](https://www.meetup.com/witheartland/events/259509370/)
looks to be an *AWESOME* talk.   I urge you to consider attending in person.
2. Storming, Norming, Forming, and Performing.   This study group is for you and I want you to get as
much as you can from it, please.  What's in it for me?  I dream of:

   1. taking lessons learned from this study group 
   2. seperating them from confidential details about the members of the group and any propritary information
   3. Putting the result in a github repo for anyone to use.

# Google: selenium java quick start

The google above leads to a nice looking [getting started with Selenium](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCS/Getting+Started+with+Selenium+for+Automated+Website+Testing) document.   Google even previews the steps in a search:

There are seven basic steps in creating a Selenium test script, which apply to any test case and any application under test (AUT). 

1. Create a WebDriver instance.
2. Navigate to a Web page.
3. Locate an HTML element on the Web page.
4. Perform an action on an HTML element.
5. Anticipate the browser response to the action.
6. Run tests and record test results using a test framework.
7. Conclude the test.

## Combining selenium quick start and Java Quick Start
1. Some of you are new to both Java and Selenium.  Let's try to combine the learning of the two.   It's an experiment.
2. For [traditional java learning resources](..) please see the list in the top level of this repo.
