# InvitationOnlyStudyGroup1

Experiment one in creating a reusable invitation only study group.   You can use these materials to create your own study group.  I hope you do, this is why I want to keep the notes in github.   These notes will not contain any personally identifiable details of the participants without their consent.

# Background

## Learning some java and some programming:

https://books.trinket.io/thinkjava/ is a free and well respected book.    That's a link to an interactive version where you can edit and run the examples :-)   It's described as " Think Java is an excellent introduction to computer science and programming intended for people with little or no experience."


https://codingbat.com/java is a nifty free site.   It's lots of practice problems.  Wonderful that you can work them in the web browser!  And it has this cool way to designate a teacher (can be anyone) then you can see the other persons solutions.     I have a simple program https://github.com/payne/CodingBatLeaderBoard to build a leader board from a group of people going through the exercises.


## Learning with specific example(s) and optional flipped learning

As a facilitator of this study group I want to enable the participants to engage in as little or as much self study as they want.  Tactics to achive this goal include:

1. Finding existing examples of the materials.   This will enable people to dig into those examples between meetings.   Examples will be clearly marked: (a) tried this and here are the notes about getting it working (b) have not tried it and here are some notes about the source (known good/looks good/unknown).
2. Plan meetings in advance so people know what to expect and if some preparation is required (and exactly what that preparation is):
